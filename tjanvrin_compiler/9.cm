/* 
There are six errors in this file:

A function prototype on line 24 with 
invalid arguments. This is similar to 
the same problem for functions on 
previous slides, but I had to implement
it twice since function declarations
and prototypes are defined differntly.

On lines 27, 28, 29, and 32,
we've got some examples of duplicated
and invalid operators. I've put multiple, 
to demonstrate that my error handling 
can handle different kinds of duplicates.
My error handling defaults to choosing the
leftmost operator.

Finally, on line 35, I've got in invalid parameter
on a function call. Since it can't parse this,
it defaults to a NilExp.
