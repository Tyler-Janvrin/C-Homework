This assignment makes use of the example code provided by Dr. Fei Song on the Courselink site: tiny.flex, Scanner.java, and Token.java

To compile the code, run "make". You might have to change the filepath to jflex in the makefile. Right now, it's just set to "JFLEX=jflex", which works on the SOCS server. 

To run the code, run "java Scanner < yourfile.txt", where yourfile.txt can be whatever file you want the scanner to run on.
